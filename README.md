# Every Street

**DISCLAIMER**: This repository is still a work in progress

This repository is a part of a project to ride a bicycle on every street of Selinsgrove, PA, my home town. Selinsgrove is a small town, with only 6,000 people and less than 5 square kilometers of land. I believe it is possible to cover every street within the span of 1 day (and hopefully a lot less than that). In order to meet this time requirement though, we will want to compute the _provably_ shortest path we can take which will cover the length of each street once. In computer science, this problem is known as the [route inspection problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_postman_problem).

If we model every street and intersection as edges and nodes within a graph, then we can run this algorithm and it will generate a route which is the shortest possible path that covers each street at least once. In order to do this, we will need to collect data on the town in question.

## The data
I was interested in creating a general method that is applicable for any given city / area of interest, not just my hometown. The best (open source!) method I could find for collecting this kind of data is a website called [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). In short, you can think of this website as a sort of wikipedia but for mapping. It's maintained by an active and vibrant community of mappers who are dedicated to reporting accurate information about... Well anything you can find on a map!

The feature that interests this project the most is the "export" feature. It's in the top left of the screen and manually let's you select a box that you can export a custom file type called .osm. More on that later.

In the example above, you can see we are trying to select San Francisco. There are some issues with this, namely that we can only draw a rectangular box. Because of this, we are clipping into Alcatraz Island a bit in the upper right side. Because of this, we are going to have to do some (manually) processing to clean up the file we export.

Clicking export will generate a .osm file. These are an extension on the XML format, and should be painless to parse because of that. This file type is covered by a unique license, the [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/). Because this repo is covered under the GPL, I will not include any .osm files, but if you clone this repo, they are generally stored in "./data/". If you are interested in learning more about the .osm file format (which will be important for parsing it into a graph), more information can be found [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML).
